Hi World !🌏
I am student of Masai School from Web17 batch and I am presenting our project- clone of Youtube, built during Unit-3.

# Details : 🔭
As we all are familiar with youtube which is installed in every mobile and every person used it for different purpose like educational,entertainment,and also some used it for exploring new things.
So I tried to clone youtube as far as possible.

## Learning :-

- My code writing style became cleaner as I have used ES6 to write code and used import export so that code become well structured.

- I learn about many CSS properties that I didn't know before.

- My skills in JavaScript and DOM manipulation became better.
